# An-interactive-VTK-using-TCL-
An interactive VTK( The visualization toolkit) for Iso surfaces using TCL 


Steps to run this program- 

1) This program has been implemented in TCL for VTK. 

2) To run the program use the following syntax:

Type this in terminal - vtk q1.tcl and vtk q2.tcl

3) The project was very interesting but I had open questions like how to calculate mix/max iso value, because I did not  have a clear idea. I hardcoded the values based on a brute-force method.
